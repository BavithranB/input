# Taking input from the user

"""
Input and Output (I/O) refers to the communication between a program and the outside world:

Input: Data received by the program (from the user, file, etc.).
Output: Data sent from the program (to the screen, file, etc.).
Python provides built-in functions and file handling capabilities for both.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Displaying output
print("Hello", name + "!")
print("You are", age, "years old.")
